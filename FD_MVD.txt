List of FDs and MVDs for Programming Project

-----:Functional Dependencies:-----

call_number -> title, format
call_number, copy_number -> barcode                    (buc?)
call_number, copy_number -> date_due, borrower_id
barcode -> call_number, copy_number, title, format     (buc?)

borrower_id -> first_name, last_name, catagory_name
borrower_id, title, date_due -> date_returned, amount

catagory_name -> checkout_period, max_books_out



-----:Multi-Valued Dependencies:-----

call_number ->> copy_number
call_number ->> author_name
call_number ->> keyword

barcode ->> keyword
barcode ->> author_name

borrower_id ->> phone

(Note to self: MVDs like x ->> y are for when there is ONE x (e.g. one borrower)
that can refer to multiple ys (e.g. phone numbers), not when there are MULTIPLE
x (e.g. phone numbers) that refer to ONE y (borrower))

(buc?) = barcode unique for each copy = I think so, additionally the schema
diagram seems to confirm this because bar_code can be determined by
call_number and copy_number together.
